                <p id="bottom">“The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that
                    Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago. But where did that
                    knowledge exist? Only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if
                    all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie
                    passed into history and became truth. ‘Who controls the past,’ ran the Party slogan, ‘controls the
                    future: who controls the present controls the past.’ And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never
                    had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple.
                    All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. ‘Reality control’,
                    they called it: in Newspeak, ‘doublethink’.”</p>
